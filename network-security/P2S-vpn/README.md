# VPN
- The aim of using a VPN is to allow secure communication between devices and internal applications running in an Azure VNet over the internet — without using public IPs of VNet resources.
Traffic flowing over the internet is exposed to all kinds of threats. A VPN creates a secure tunnel through the internet.
- The VPN tunnel can use different protocols such as OpenVPN, Secure Socket Tunneling, and IKEv2, etc.
- Client computers need to authenticate to the VPN to access resources.
- This authentication can be done using a certificate, Entra ID, etc.

## There are two types of VPN connections:

- Point-to-Site (P2S) — VPN connection is established between an individual device (or devices) and a network. Example: When a remote employee logs in to their organization’s network from home.

- Site-to-Site (S2S) — VPN connection between two networks. This is an always-on connection. All devices on one network can automatically access the other network without requiring client software on individual devices. Example: Connection between the networks of an on-premises data center and the cloud or a hybrid cloud setup.

## Point-to-Site VPN: Implementation Overview
1. Deploy a Windows web server with Internet Information Services (IIS) - Test the connection with this server over the internet first, then remove its public IP. The goal is to connect to this server over the internet using a VPN.

2. Deploy a VPN Gateway - The VPN Gateway and its resources are deployed in a dedicated subnet called Gateway Subnet. The VPN Gateway will have a public IP.
(Cost consideration: VPN Gateways are billed per hour and can be expensive)

3. Authenticate clients - For lab purposes, we’ll use a self-signed certificate generated using a PowerShell script.

4. Download and install the VPN client from the VPN Gateway on the client machine to establish the VPN connection.
